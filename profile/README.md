Hello! :wave:

This is the GitHub page for my company JN Programutveckling AB. Who am I? I'm [Johan Nilsson](https://github.com/olivertwistor), a computer engineer from Sweden with a love for gaming and accessibility.

JN Programutveckling AB develops applications and games, as well as educational resources regarding accessibility and software design. I'm also open to helping out on software projects. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:kontakt@jn-programutveckling.se) for more information.

Many of the projects I'm working on are hidden away in private repositories. Some projects are public and visible on the [organisation repository page](https://github.com/orgs/jn-programutveckling/repositories). For updates on the hidden projects, please see my company's website (still in development; I will post a link to it once it's online).

## Previous work experience

The bulk of my previous work experience has revolved around web development in various forms. I've worked with Java EE, PHP and static websites. Although I have mostly worked as a full-stack developer, I enjoy back-end the most. Please check out my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johan-nilsson-2661456a/) for more information.

## Programming languages

My main programming language is Java, but I also use PHP, HTML/CSS, Python and C#. Recently, I've also delved into the wondrous world of JavaScript and specifically Node.js. My next language in my to-learn list is GDScript, a scripting language for the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/).
