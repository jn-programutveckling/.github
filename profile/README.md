Hello! :wave:

This is the GitHub page for my company JN Programutveckling AB. Who am I? I'm [Johan Nilsson](https://github.com/olivertwistor), a computer engineer from Sweden with a love for gaming and accessibility.

JN Programutveckling AB develops applications and games, as well as educational resources regarding accessibility and software design. I'm also open to helping out on software projects. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:kontakt@jn-programutveckling.se) for more information.

Many of the projects I'm working on are hidden away in private repositories. Some projects are public and visible on the [organisation repository page](https://github.com/orgs/jn-programutveckling/repositories). For updates on all my projects, please see my company's website at [jn-programutveckling.se](https://www.jn-programutveckling.se). Also, please be aware that projects with a version number lower than 1.0.0 can change drastically without prior notice and even removed or hidden from public view until it reaches version 1.0.0.

## Previous work experience

The bulk of my previous work experience has revolved around web development in various forms. I've worked with Java EE, PHP and static websites. Although I have mostly worked as a full-stack developer, I enjoy back-end the most. Please check out my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johan-nilsson-2661456a/) for more information.

## Programming languages

My main programming language is Java, but I also use PHP, HTML/CSS, Python and C#. Recently, I've also dipped my toes into Node.js and GDScript.

## Open for work

As stated on the ["contact work" page on my company website](https://www.jn-programutveckling.se/uppdrag/) (written in Swedish, sorry!), I'm open for contract work. Please check out that page for more information. Even if you don't speak Swedish, I think Google Translate does a decent job with translating it.
